# youtube_crawler

This is a python based web scraper that, given a work or phrase, gets all the video urls that youtube would give upon searching it in the youtube search engine. It gets video urls from the first five pages, and writes them to a file. To avoid getting the ip banned, it scrapes proxy urls from websites, and uses them randomly.
