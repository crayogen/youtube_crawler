# youtube_crawler

This is a python based web scraper that, given a word or phrase, gets all the video urls that you would get upon searching it in the youtube search engine. It gets video urls from the first five pages of the search results, and writes them to a file. To avoid getting your ip banned, it scrapes proxy urls from websites, and uses them randomly.
